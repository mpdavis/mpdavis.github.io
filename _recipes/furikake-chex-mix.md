## Ingredients

### Mixins
* 1 box Corn Chex
* 1 box Wheat Chex
* 1 box Honey-Comb cereal
* 1 bag Bugles
* 1 bag Fritos
* 1 bag pretzels (Snyder Butter Snaps)
* 1 jar honey roasted peanuts

### Glaze
* 2 sticks butter
* 1 cup light corn syrup (can sub honey)
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup vegetable oil (Something neutral, I used avocodo oil because we are hipsters)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 bottle (1.7 oz) furikake rice seasoning

## Instructions
Preheat your oven to 250 degrees. 

You'll need a couple of large pans. I used a couple of disposable aluminum roasting pans that were on sale after Thanksgiving. If you use normal pans, I would highly reccomend spraying them with oil to avoid the glaze from being a pain to clean off. 

Throw all of your mixins into whatever big pans you are using. You can change out the exact mixins that you use. Goldfish crackers are pretty popular, but Kirsten hates them so I didn't put any in. I've seen people use wasabi peas, which looked good. I like the Snyders Snaps as a pretzel, because of their shape. All I could find were the butter snaps, which was fine, but I would have prefered the regular ones I think. Don't use pretzel sticks because they are clearly the worst pretzel shape. 

Throw all of the glaze ingredients in a pot and put them on medium-low heat. Stir everything together and let the sugar come up to a light boil, stirring along the way. Watch the pot closely so the sugar mixture doesn't boil over. Let it boil for a few minutes, stiring so the bottom doesn't scorch. Turn the heat off and let the sugar mixture cool a bit. 

Pour the cooled (but still warm) glaze over the mixins and stir to cover everything. After the first couple of stirs, dump in the furikake and continue to stir until coated. 

Place in the oven for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. You might need a few more minutes in the oven, depending on your local humidity and whatnot. After you pull it out, continue to stir it every few minutes as it cools so that it doesn't harden into one giant clump of chex mix. 

## Vegan Alterations
Use vegan mixins. It looks like General Mills puts vitamin D3 in everything they make, so their Chex cereal isn't vegan, but I'm guessing there are vegan alternatives. Kirsten and I thought Cap'n Crunch would be a good cereal to use, which could be a substitute for the Honeycomb. Normal roasted peanuts would be great in place of the honey roasted ones, or just omit entirely. 

Sub margarine or coconut oil for butter in the glaze.
