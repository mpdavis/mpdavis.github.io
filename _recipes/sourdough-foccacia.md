## Ingredients

- 100g active starter (100% hydration)
- 10g kosher salt
- 440g water
- 512g King Arthur bread flour
- Olive oil
- Crisco
- Salt, preferably a flaky sea salt like Maldonâ€™s

## Instructions

Add the water, starter and salt to a large bowl and mix. Add the flour and mix, making sure all of the flour is hydrated.

Stretch and fold the dough every 30 minutes, 3-4 times.

Drizzle the dough with olive oil and let sit on the counter until doubled, 8-18 hours.

Grease a 9x13 pan with crisco, and drizzle in a healthy bit of oil. 2-3 tablespoons.

Pull the dough away from the sides of the bowl and place it into the pan. Fold the dough envelope style and flip it over so that the smooth side of the dough is facing up. Cover and let sit on the counter 4-6 hours, or until puffy and nearly doubled.

Drizzle olive oil over the dough and dimple the bread with your fingers. Sprinkle generously with sea salt.

Bake on the bottom rack of a 425 degree oven for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown all over. Pull the bread out of the pan immediately and place it onto a cooling rack. Cool at least 20 minutes before slicing.
