## Ingredients

* ~3 lb chuck roast
* 1 package Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix
* 4-6 cups beef broth
* 24 oz Mrs Reams frozen homestyle egg noodles
* 1 onion
* 2 bay leaves
* worchestershire sauce
* salt
* pepper
* onion powder
* garlic powder

### Instructions

Season the chuck roast with salt and sear it in a dutch oven over high heat with a little bit of oil. Remove the roast from the pan.

Dice the onion and sweat it in the same pan. Once the onions are cooked, return the roast and add enough beef broth to almost cover the roast. Add the onion soup mix, and season with garlic  powder, onion powder, pepper and worchestershire sauce to taste. Add the bay leaves. 

Bring the broth to a boil and place the dutch oven in a 325 degree oven with the lid slightly uncovered. Braise the roast until tender, about 4 hours. Remove the roast and shred it, removing any large pieces of fat or gristle.

Put the broth on the stove and bring it to a boil. Remove the bay leaves. Add the frozen noodles and cook according to directions. Add some water or beef broth if there isn't enough liquid for the noodles. They will soak up more than you think. 

A few minutes before the noodles are done, add the shreded roast back to the pan.
