## Ingredients

- 300g King Arthur bread flour
- 5g instant yeast
- 9g kosher salt
- 220g water
- Olive oil
- Crisco
- Pizza sauce
- 12 ounces cheese (Traditionally brick cheese, but you can use a 50/50 blend of low-moisture mozzarella and monterey jack)

## Instructions

Combine the flour, yeast and salt in the mixer bowl, stir to combine. Add the water and mix on low speed with the dough hook until the dough comes together. Shut the mixer off and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.

Continue mixing on low about 10 minutes, until the dough forms a smooth ball. Remove the dough hook and form the dough into a tight ball and place back into the mixer bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled, roughly 2 hours.

Grease the bottom of the pizza pan with crisco. Transfer the dough to the pan and drizzle it with oil. Spread it out as much as you can, but you won’t be able to stretch it all the way to the edges. Let sit for 30 minutes and stretch the dough again. If you still can’t get the dough to all of the edges, let sit again for another 30 minutes. Once the dough is stretched, let it sit for a final 30 minutes before topping.

Top the pizza with 12 ounces of cheese, cubed, and any other toppings above that.

On top, place the pizza sauce. I like to lay it in 3 stripes down the length of the pizza.

Place the pizza in a preheated oven, as hot as it will go. Cook the pizza for 12-15 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown. Remove from the pan and place on a cooling rack for 5-10 minutes to cool before slicing.
