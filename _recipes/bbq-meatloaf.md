## Ingredients

* 2 pounds 80/20 ground beef
* 1/2 pound bacon
* 3 eggs
* 1 large yellow onion
* 2 cups bread crumbs
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup BBQ sauce
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 3 Tbsp BBQ rub
* 3 Tbsp yellow mustard
* 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

Cut the bacon into small strips and fry it up. Remove the bacon, but keep the grease in the pan.Dice the onion and cook it in the bacon grease, sautéing until translucent. Remove the onion from the pan and let it and the bacon cool.

Combine the cooled bacon and onions with the ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar. Mix well.

Add the ground beef and sausage, and mix lightly. Add the breadcrumbs and eggs, mix until well incorporated. We add the breadcrumbs after the meat so that they don’t soak up all of the liquid.

Line 2 or 3 disposable loaf pans with saran wrap. Separate the meat mixture into the loaf pans, and fold the saran wrap over to completely cover the loafs.

Place the loaves into the freezer.

An hour before cooking, remove the meat loaves from the freezer. Unwrap the loaves and use some mustard as a binder and cover with BBQ rub.

Smoke at 280-300 degrees until 165 internal.

Glaze the loaves with BBQ sauce towards the end.
