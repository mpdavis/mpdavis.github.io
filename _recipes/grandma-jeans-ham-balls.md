## Ingredients 

### Sauce

* 1 cup tomato juice
* 1 1/2 Tbsp yellow mustard
* 1/4 cup vinegar
* 1 1/2 cup brown sugar

# Ham Balls

* 4 pounds Fareway ham loaf (50/50 ground ham and ground pork)
* 2 cup graham cracker, crumbed
* 1 1/2 cup milk
* 2 eggs
* Pepper to taste (ham loaf is already pretty salty)

## Instructions

Combine the sauce ingredients and heat on the stove to dissolve the sugar.

Combine the ham ball ingredients. Ball the meat using #20 scoop and place into a baking dish. Cover the ham balls with half of the sauce.

Bake at 325 for 30 minutes, then lower to 300 for 1.5 hours. Baste the ham balls with the remaining sauce halfway through.
