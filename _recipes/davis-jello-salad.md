## Ingredients

* 1 pkg lime jello
* 2 cups water
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/4 cup mayo
* 1 1/2 tsp horseradish
* 1/2 pkg cottage cheese
* 1 8oz can crushed pineapple, drained
* 1/2 maraschino cherry per slice (optional)

## Instructions

Add 1 cup of hot/boiling water to the lime jello mix, and whisk until the jello is completely dissolved. Add an additional 1 cup of cold water (optionally use some ice to speed up jello setting)

Place the jello in the fridge for ~20 minutes to start to set. When it is the consistency of egg whites, start to beat the mixture until light and fluffy. It will change to a pale green.

Add the milk, mayo, and horseradish and continue to mix. Make sure that the horseradish is distributed well, nobody wants a big bite of horseradish. 

Fold in the cottage cheese and pineapple. Place in a 9x9 pan to set. Keep in the fridge.

You can put 1/2 a maraschino cherry on each serving for a fetive option at Christmas.
