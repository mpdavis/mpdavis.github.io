## Ingredients

* 5 pounds chuck roast
* 1-2 soup bones (optional)
* beef broth
* 1 head of garlic
* 7-8 dried guajillo chilis
* 2-3 chili de arbol
* 4 roma tomatoes
* 1/2 inch cinnamon stick
* 4 whole cloves
* 1 tsp mexican oregeno
* 1/2 tsp majoram
* 1/2 tsp cumin seed
* 1/2 tsp peppercorns
* 2 bay leaves

## Instructions

Cut the chuck roast into a few large chunks and sear it in a large stock pot.

Pour in enough beef broth to cover the chuck roast well. Cut the onions in half and add them to the pot. Bring the pot to a simmer, skimming anything that needs to be skimmed.

Deseed the dry chilis and add them to the pot.

Add the cinnamon stick, cloves and bay leaves to the pot.

Once the onions, chilies, and spices are soft, add them all to a blender with the tomatoes, garlic, other spices. Leave the bay leaves in the pot. Blend until smooth and add it back to the pot with the beef. You can strain the mixture if it is necessary.

Simmer until the meat is tender.
