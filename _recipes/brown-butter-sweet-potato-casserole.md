## Ingredients

### Filling
* 3 large sweet potatoes, baked until soft and peeled
* 1 stick salted butter, browned
* 12 oz evaporated milk
* 1 tsp vanilla paste (or vanilla extract)
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/8 tsp ground ginger
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 tbsp flour
* 3 eggs, room temperature and beaten

### Topping
* 5 tbsp salted butter, melted
* 2/3 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 cup AP flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup pecans, chopped or pieces (I prefer chopped or pieces because it makes it easier to cut the pie)

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees

Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Cook until browned and set aside to cool.

Purée cooked sweet potatoes in a blender until smooth. In a large bowl, add puréed sweet potatoes, browned butter, milk, vanilla, spices, sugar, flour and eggs.

Pour into par-baked pie crust. Aluminum pans work better for par-baking pie crusts, since glass pie pans cause the pie crust to shrink as it cooks.

Mix the topping ingredients in a bowl. Top the pies with the topping

Bake for 55 minutes.

Remove from oven and let pie cool completely until the middle is set. Refrigerate for 3-4 hours for a dense & creamy pie
